SAP sells to large, multifaceted enterprises, and implementations are a big deal, often requiring outside help.</p><p>“Most organizations don’t buy SAP because they have simple problems to solve,” said Geoff Scott, CEO of the Americas’ SAP Users’ Group (ASUG). “You purchase it because you’re a complex organization with complex business processes.”</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2923192/sap-journeys-to-simplicity-but-customers-still-live-in-a-complex-world.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<article> <section class="page"> <p>If it’s new Android apps and games you seek, then our latest Five to Try roundup has you covered. The top pick this week is Microsoft’s Hyperlapse Mobile beta—FYI: you must join a certain Google+ group to unlock the Play Store link—which beats Instagram’s app to Android and lets you create slick time-lapse videos with ease. Also new is ephemeral messaging app Bleep, plus Google Fit’s latest update adds some helpful features.</p><p>On the gaming front, <em>Snake Rewind</em> gets all nostalgic about the early days of mobile games, delivering a proper sequel to the built-in Nokia classic, and <em>Languinis</em> mashes up match-three and word puzzlers in an intriguing free-to-play concoction. Clear some space on your phone and give these five a shot.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2923074/five-to-try-microsofts-hyperlapse-video-app-and-snake-rewind-revives-a-mobile-classic.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<article> <section class="page"> <p> Google's Chromecast dongle is getting a little more love from TV networks, with new app support for CBS, Fox Now, FX Now, and HGTV Watch.</p><p> Users can now download these apps for iOS or Android, then hit the Cast button in the app to send any video to the television. CBS, Fox, and FX have also added Chromecast support to their websites, so Chrome users who've installed the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd?hl=en">Google Cast extension</a> can send just the video without having to mirror the entire page.</p><p> Unfortunately, if you don't have traditional TV service, CBS is the only app worth using. Most of its shows include several full episodes for free, and you can watch entire series and live programming with a $6-per-month All Access subscription. The other three apps put nearly all their episodes behind a pay-TV paywall. (HGTV has a handful of free episodes, but you really have to dig around to find them.)</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2923036/chromecast-gets-four-more-tv-network-apps-heres-what-it-still-needs.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<article> <section class="page"> <p> The death of Samsung Wallet has a hard date. The company is killing off the service on June 30, with <a href="http://www.greenbot.com/cms/article/samsunggalaxys6-100575486-primary.idge">Samsung Pay</a> set to rise from its ashes.</p><p> The <a href="http://wallet.samsung.com">Samsung Wallet site</a> now has a shutdown notice, informing visitors of the bad news. However, the focus is shifting to Samsung Pay, which packs technology that will allow for non-NFC payment terminals to accept mobile payments.</p><p> <strong>The story behind the story:</strong> Samsung has big ambitions for Samsung Pay, touting it as more secure and superior to <a href="http://greenbot.com/tag/googlewallet">Google Wallet</a> and <a href="http://macworld.com/tag/applepay">Apple Pay</a>. The key is making the process seamless enough so that pulling out your phone will be more convenient than taking out your wallet.

<article> <section class="page"> <p> Sure, you’ll have to sell both your kidneys to buy it, but at least now you can finally have 128GB of cutting-edge RAM in your PC.</p><p> This week, Corsair announced it is now selling two 128GB DDR4 RAM kits while Kingston touted that its upcoming big-ass set will hit speeds of 3000MHz.</p><p> <strong>Why this matters:</strong> The move from DDR3 to DDR4 last year (in high-end machines) promised lower voltage, higher-frequencies and higher capacities—eventually. While the average consumer certainly doesn’t need 128GB of RAM to run Microsoft Word or play a video game, some power users do indeed need seemingly crazy amounts of RAM. Also, can you say <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/260918/how_to_supercharge_your_pc_with_a_ram_disk.html">100GB DDR4 RAM drive</a> with 28GB left for system RAM?

Spec showdown: HTC's J Butterfly flies past its One M9

<article> <section class="page"> <p>Unless you live in Japan, get ready to feel jealous: HTC on Thursday announced a new and impressive J Butterfly that is only available there. Here is how it compares to the One M9, currently the most advanced smartphone from HTC available globally.</p><p>Both smartphones are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 processor and have 32GB of integrated storage, but a review of the specs shows a number of opportunities HTC missed with the One M9, which started shipping in March.</p><p><strong/></p><p><strong>Screen</strong></p><p>The One M9 has a 5-inch screen and the Butterfly’s screen measures 5.2 inches. But the newcomer has a 1440 x 2560 pixel resolution compared to 1080 x 1920 pixels on the One M9. That puts the Butterfly on par with competitors like Samsung’s Galaxy S6 and LG’s G4. To go along with all those pixels, the Butterfly also has a bigger battery. You can say what you like about whether the higher resolution is necessary, but One M9 is at a distinct disadvantage.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2923092/spec-showdown-htcs-j-butterfly-flies-past-its-one-m9.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>

All that’s required is the device’s wake-up word (“Alexa” by default) followed by “re-order [item name].” Echo then finds the item and asks for confirmation to buy it, either with a “yes” or a voice code.</p><p> Shopping isn’t strictly restricted to past purchases. If Echo doesn’t find the item in the user’s order history, but can recommend something similar, it’ll tell users the name and price before giving them the option to buy it. If it doesn’t find anything, it’ll add the item name to the user’s shopping list. (You can also say “Alexa, cancel order” if you’ve bought something by accident.)</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2922529/amazon-echo-update-lets-you-shop-without-raising-a-finger.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>

They’re an even bigger part of the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> franchise’s success on PCs. But malicious no-goodniks out there have seized advantage of the current spotlight on <em>GTA V </em>to slip nasty keylogger malware into some of the mods available for the game—including the otherwise awesome-looking “Angry Planes” mod that made the rounds on the big gaming sites this week.</p><p><a href="http://gtaforums.com/topic/794383-possibility-of-trojan-downloaderspyware-installed-via-gta-v-mod/?st=0">GTA Forums member aboutseven</a> first noticed Angry Planes misbehaving, <a href="http://kotaku.com/psa-some-top-gta-v-mods-have-nasty-viruses-1704480631">Kotaku</a> reports.

Give Wikipedia a sleek, user-friendly visual overhaul with the Wikiwand extension

<article> <section class="page"> <p> Wikipedia is easily the greatest compendium of human knowledge ever created. Sure, academics have their issues with it and pranksters love messing with it, but as a starting point to learn about pretty much any topic you can think of you simply can’t beat Wikipedia.</p><p> But it does have its downsides. One thing that’s always irked me is the interface. On the PC, to put it bluntly, it sucks. It’s very busy, with text and boxes everywhere, and the article navigation links are oddly placed.</p><p> A Chrome extension called Wikiwand aims to change all that by giving Wikipedia a much-needed visual overhaul. To use it all you have to do is download the extension from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wikiwand-wikipedia-modern/emffkefkbkpkgpdeeooapgaicgmcbolj">Chrome Web Store</a> and it starts working automatically any time you visit Wikipedia. It’s not perfect, however, and security-conscious users may not like it.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2922493/give-wikipedia-a-sleek-user-friendly-visual-overhaul-with-the-wikiwand-extension.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<article> <section class="page"> <p>China’s government is pressing for faster Internet access speeds and lower prices, two moves that aim to boost the number of its citizens going online.</p><p>On Friday, all three of China’s telecommunications operators announced plans to lower broadband and data plan costs for consumers. This came a month after China’s premier <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2893472/china-aims-to-help-local-internet-firms-cross-into-the-global-market.html">Li Keqiang</a> said the country needed to do more to expand Internet access.</p><p>China has the world’s largest Internet-connected citizenry at over 649 million users, but that’s still less than half of the country’s population. And average Internet speeds in China are 3.4 megabits per second(Mbps), far lower than the U.S. where average access speeds reach 11.1 Mbps, according to Akamai Technologies.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2922972/china-pushes-for-big-jump-in-internet-speeds.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<article> <section class="page"> <p> Samsung’s Galaxy S6 and LG’s G4 have officially set the precedent for photography in high-end Android phones. Manufacturers, if your upcoming device doesn’t take photos as well as either of these devices, you’re doing something seriously wrong. </p><p> The Galaxy S6 is equipped with a 16-megapixel camera with an f/1.9 aperture, optical image stabilization, and tracking autofocus. It also uses a rear-facing LED flash and features manual focus capability. I used a Galaxy S6 Edge for this test, which has the exact same camera sensor and software as its flat brother. </p><p> The G4 features a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera with an f/1.8 aperture, three-axis optical image stabilization, dual-tone LED flash, and hybrid infrared autofocus. It also incorporates a new “RGB color spectrum sensor.”</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2922316/tested-the-lg-g4-has-dethroned-the-samsung-galaxy-s6-as-the-best-camera-phone.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>

Once you download the apps you want (Office! Xbox! Music!) from the Windows Store, the experience actually feels rather welcoming. Not all of your apps carry over, and there are some rather alarming bugs.
